# Load Libraries
ggplot2 is used for graphs, dplyr might be unused

Had to run the command below from the terminal to get this to knit
Sys.setenv(RSTUDIO_PANDOC = "C:/Program Files/RStudio/resources/app/bin/quarto/bin/tools")



```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

# Function to run PhreeqC 
This function runs a PhreeqC code passed using the input_string. A PhreeqC database must also be specified. The output is a dataframe. PhreeqC output is controlled by the SELECTED_OUTPUT block in PhreeqC. The computer running this will need to have IPhreeqc installed.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) +
  geom_point()
```
