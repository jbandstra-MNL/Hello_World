# Function to run PhreeqC 
This function runs a PhreeqC code passed using the input_string. A PhreeqC database must also be specified. The output is a dataframe. PhreeqC output is controlled by the SELECTED_OUTPUT block in PhreeqC. The computer running this will need to have IPhreeqc installed.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```
